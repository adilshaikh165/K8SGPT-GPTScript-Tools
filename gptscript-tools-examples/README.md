# GPTScript tools examples and usecases

This repository contains real-world examples demonstrating how GPTScript tools can be leveraged for Kubernetes troubleshooting and diagnostics. It includes a variety of use cases showcasing the power of GPTScript Systems tools in addressing common Kubernetes challenges. These examples cover troubleshooting scenarios such as pod failures, service disruptions, network issues, resource utilization, and many other operational problems within Kubernetes clusters.

For more detailed information on GPTScript tools and their capabilities, refer to the official documentation at [GPTScript Tools Documentation](https://tools.gptscript.ai/search?q=sys.).

## Create Issues in Kubernetes Cluster

I have created a YAML manifest `/k8s-deployments` specifically designed to introduce intentional issues and faults within the Kubernetes cluster. These simulated problems will serve as controlled test cases, enabling us to use GPTScript tools for troubleshooting and resolving common cluster-related issues. By leveraging these issues, we can experiment with the effectiveness and capabilities of GPTScript in diagnosing and remediating Kubernetes faults.

Apply the manifest files using the below command

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment
```

Now that issues and faults have been intentionally introduced into our Kubernetes cluster, let's dive deeper into the GPTScript tools I’ve developed to analyze and troubleshoot these cluster problems. These tools are designed to effectively diagnose and resolve the raised issues, offering powerful insights and solutions for maintaining the health and stability of the Kubernetes environment.

## GPTScript Tools Usecases

I have prepared a few examples of `.gpt` files to help you understand how GPTScript tools function in practice. These examples, listed below, will demonstrate the practical application of the tools and showcase their capabilities in Kubernetes troubleshooting and analysis.

### #1. Pod Inspector

The "Pod Debugger" script is designed to analyze Kubernetes pods experiencing restart or crash-loop issues. It uses Kubernetes commands like kubectl get pods, kubectl describe pod, and kubectl logs to identify root causes such as OOMKilled events, invalid image references, or health check failures. Based on its findings, the script recommends fixes and provides actionable commands to resolve the issues, ultimately improving pod stability across the cluster.

```bash
---
Name: Pod Debugger
Description: Debugs Kubernetes pods with restart or crash-loop issues.
Context: shared-context
Tools: sys.exec
Parameter: command: The Kubernetes command to debug pods.
Chat: false

Analyze pods in a crash-loop or restarting state using `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl describe pod`, and `kubectl logs`.  
Look for:
- OOMKilled events.
- Invalid image references.
- Readiness/liveness probe failures.

For each issue:
1. Recommend fixes like updating resource limits, correcting container images, or adjusting health checks.
2. If required, provide commands to update or recreate faulty resources.

Please analyze the entire cluster fix the issues for broken pods. Output findings in an actionable and clear format.

### #2. Node Inspector

The "Node Inspector" script is designed to evaluate the health and performance of Kubernetes nodes within a cluster. It utilizes kubectl get nodes and kubectl describe nodes to detect nodes in "NotReady" states and identify resource constraints like CPU, memory, disk pressure, and network issues. The script also checks for taints and labels that could affect pod scheduling. It provides a detailed assessment of node health, along with actionable remedies, such as clearing disk space, adding resources, or adjusting taints to improve overall cluster stability.

```bash
---
Name: Node Inspector
Description: Analyzes Kubernetes nodes for resource constraints and other issues.
Context: shared-context
Tools: sys.exec
Parameter: command: The Kubernetes command to check node status.
Chat: false

Inspect all nodes in the cluster using `kubectl get nodes` and `kubectl describe nodes`. Identify any nodes in `NotReady` or similar states.  
Check for:
- Resource constraints (CPU, memory pressure).
- Disk pressure or network unavailability.
- Taints and labels that may cause scheduling issues.

Provide detailed feedback on:
- Node health.
- Potential remedies (e.g., clearing disk space, adding resources, removing unnecessary taints).
Summarize findings in human-readable format.

### Analysis
- **Node Utilization:** The node is underutilized with only 1% CPU and 8% memory usage.
- **Pod Utilization:** All pods are using minimal resources, with no pod hitting resource limits.

### Recommendations
- Consider optimizing resource requests and limits for pods to better utilize node capacity.
- Monitor the cluster for any changes in workload that might affect resource utilization.

```

### #3. Network Troubleshooting

The "Network Troubleshooter" script is designed to identify and resolve network connectivity issues within a Kubernetes cluster. It checks pod-to-pod connectivity by running ping commands between pods, reviews network policies to ensure proper communication, and examines network-related events in the Kubernetes event stream. The script also investigates potential issues with network plugins or CNI configurations. After completing these checks, it provides a comprehensive summary of the network status, highlighting any issues and suggesting improvements to optimize connectivity and performance within the cluster.

```bash
---
Name: Network Troubleshooter
Description: Investigates network connectivity issues in the Kubernetes cluster.
Context: shared-context
Tools: sys.exec
Parameter: command: The Kubernetes command to debug networking.
Chat: false

Get the list of all pods in my kubernetes cluster and do the following steps
Check for network connectivity issues between pods by running `kubectl exec <pod-name> -c <container-name> -- ping <target-pod-ip>`.
Analyze network policies to ensure proper communication between pods and services.
Check for any network-related events in the Kubernetes event stream.
Investigate potential issues with network plugins or CNI configurations.
Provide a summary of network connectivity and performance within the cluster, highlighting any potential issues or areas for improvement.

### #5. Building CLI Agent

In this case, the agent first validates the command to ensure its correctness, rewrites it if needed, and then executes it. In contrast, the CLI tool executes the command directly unless explicitly instructed to do otherwise.

```bash
Name: CLI-Agent-Caller
Tools: cli-Agent

Execute the CLI command provided and return the output.

---
Name: cli-agent
Tools: sys.exec
Description: I execute CLI commands on the local system.
Args: command: The CLI command to execute.
Chat: false

#prompt/instruction
Ensure the command is valid, modify it if needed, and then complete the task.
You can run CLI commands on the local system. You are an alpine-based or darwin-based system.
If the cli tool is not installed, then install it.
```
I deliberately introduced a spelling mistake in the namespace, but the agent was smart enough to detect the error, correct the namespace, and seamlessly use the corrected version in subsequent commands. If it weren’t for the agent, and only the CLI was used, the incorrect namespace would have gone uncorrected, leading to continued troubleshooting with the wrong name and preventing proper diagnosis and resolution of the cluster issues.

OUTPUT:

Your Kubernetes cluster in the `defaaautltt` namespace has several issues:

1. **Pods with Issues:**
   - `crash-loop-pod`: Status is `CrashLoopBackOff`.
   - `faulty-image-tag-deployment-66b965f5b9-xx85j`: Status is `ImagePullBackOff`.
   - `nasty-pod`: Status is `Pending`.
   - `wrong-image-deployment-5c997dd5f-xn62j`: Status is `ImagePullBackOff`.

2. **Deployments with Issues:**
   - `faulty-image-tag-deployment`: 0/1 pods are available.
   - `wrong-image-deployment`: 0/1 pods are available.

These issues indicate problems with image pulling and pod readiness.

```

### #6. Simple Kubernetes fix

When the user inquires about potential issues with the cluster, the question is routed to a Request Handler. This Request Handler functions as an entry point rather than a tool or agent. It is aware of the Kubernetes agent and shares context with it, including specific instructions for handling the request. The Request Handler then forwards the user's query to the Kubernetes agent, following these predefined instructions.

The Kubernetes agent executes its task by leveraging an AI backend to identify and resolve any cluster-related issues. Once the task is complete, it provides the user with a comprehensive, human-readable summary of the actions taken.

```bash
---
Name: Request Handler
Description: A request handler that receives and delegates user requests.
Context: shared-context
Agents: kubernetes-agent
Chat: false

Receive the user's request and determine if it requires Kubernetes cluster analysis. If it does, delegate the task to the Kubernetes agent. Provide feedback to the user based on the results from the Kubernetes agent.


---
Name: kubernetes-agent
Description: A Kubernetes agent that analyzes the cluster for potential issues.
Context: shared-context
Tools: sys.exec
Parameter: command: The Kubernetes command that should be executed for analysis
Chat: false

Analyze the Kubernetes cluster for any potential issues by executing relevant kubectl commands to assess node status, pod health, and other key metrics.
If no issues are apparent from the initial metadata, delve deeper using kubectl logs to gather more detailed information. Report on any identified problems and suggest solutions.
As a Kubernetes expert, focus on addressing the root cause of issues—for example, if a pod has e.g. an incorrect image reference, correct the deployment configuration rather than just resolving the pod-level issue.
You should fix all the potential issues found in kubernetes cluster rather than just listing down the issues to the user. If there are some kubernetes Object like Pods or Services If you don't know hat to do about it just delete it and give an user appropriate response. fix it, summarize it es an human readable output.
